# Pymaceuticals-Quantitative-Analysis
This project is a part of the Module 5 challenge in the Vanderbilt University Data Analytics BootCamp and is written entirely by the author of the repository. This README template is from the Data Science Working Group.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to conduct a quantitative analysis of the data collected during a clinical study on mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in order to make conclusions on the effectiveness of a specific drug treatment in relation to the others. In practice, this is a useful application for cleaning and organizing data from a series of drug trials and visualizing the data with matplotlib. 

### Methods Used
* Summary Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Correlation Statistics
* Regression Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Matplotlib

## Project Description
The data source for this project comes from Mockaroo, a data generator useful for demoing new software. This limits the data analysis to entirely hypothetical for the arbitrary pharmaceutical company of Pymaceuticals Inc.; although, the drug of interest Capomulin shows significant potential for treatment of SCC. The primary statistical methods used in the project could be applied to any clincal study analyzing the effectiveness of drug treatment with data that is uniquely identifiable and produce quantitative analyses of statistical significance.
